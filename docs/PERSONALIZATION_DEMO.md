- Go to Console tab
- Filter for `[PERSONALIZATION]` and `[BANDIT]` logs

### 3. Open Two Browser Tabs
- **Tab 1:** Main search interface (`http://localhost:5173`)
- **Tab 2:** Preferences dashboard (optional, for visualization)

---

## Demo Script

### PHASE 1: Cold Start (No Personalization)

**Query 1: "How does React useEffect work?"**

**Talking Points:**
> "Let me search for a React technical question. Notice this is the first query - the system has no data about my preferences yet."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Results shown with BM25 ranking only
- No personalization boosts visible
- Console shows: `[BANDIT] Recorded X impressions for demo-user`
- PersonalizationBadge shows: "0 interactions" or hidden

**Action:**
1. Enter query: "How does React useEffect work?"
2. Wait for results to load
3. **Click on the most technical/expert-level source** (e.g., React official docs, detailed tutorial)

**Key Point:**
> "I just clicked on a technical, expert-level source. The Thompson Sampling algorithm is now learning from this single interaction."

**Expected Console Logs:**
```
[BANDIT] Recorded 10 impressions for demo-user
[BANDIT] Recorded click for demo-user: depth:expert, style:technical, format:documentation, approach:practical, density:detailed
```

---

### PHASE 2: Immediate Personalization

**Query 2: "React custom hooks best practices"**

**Talking Points:**
> "Now let's search for a related topic. Watch how the system boosts sources similar to what I clicked before. This happens after just ONE click - no cold start problem."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Results are re-ranked with personalization
- Expert/technical sources move up
- Console shows personalization boosts:
  ```
  [PERSONALIZATION] Applied +18.5% boost to "React Hooks Documentation..." for features [expert, technical]
  [PERSONALIZATION] Applied +22.1% boost to "Advanced Custom Hooks Guide..." for features [expert, practical]
  ```
- Source cards show "personalized (expert, technical)" in ranking reason
- PersonalizationBadge shows: "1 interaction" with feature tags

**Action:**
1. Enter query: "React custom hooks best practices"
2. Point out the personalization boosts in console
3. Show the "personalized" tag on source cards
4. **Click on another technical source** (reinforcing preference)

**Key Point:**
> "See those green '+18.5%' logs? That's Thompson Sampling in action. It sampled from a Beta distribution based on my click history and boosted sources with similar features."

---

### PHASE 3: Cross-Topic Persistence

**Query 3: "Python async await tutorial"**

**Talking Points:**
> "Now let's try a completely different topic - Python instead of React. The personalization should still apply because it learned I prefer expert, technical content, not just React-specific sources."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Technical Python sources get boosted
- System prefers documentation/expert sources over beginner tutorials
- Console continues to show personalization:
  ```
  [PERSONALIZATION] Applied +24.3% boost to "Python Asyncio Documentation..." for features [expert, technical]
  [PERSONALIZATION] Applied +15.7% boost to "Advanced Async Patterns..." for features [expert, detailed]
  ```
- PersonalizationBadge shows: "2 interactions"

**Key Point:**
> "This is the power of semantic feature extraction. Instead of just learning 'I like React docs,' it learned 'I prefer expert-level, technical content' - which transfers across topics."

---

### PHASE 4: Show Learned Preferences (Optional)

**Check Preferences API:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/preferences?userId=demo-user"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "topArms": [
    { "arm": "depth:expert", "score": 0.72 },
    { "arm": "style:technical", "score": 0.68 },
    { "arm": "format:documentation", "score": 0.65 },
    { "arm": "approach:practical", "score": 0.61 },
    { "arm": "density:detailed", "score": 0.58 }
  ],
  "totalInteractions": 2
}
```

**Talking Points:**
> "These scores come from Thompson Sampling's Beta distribution. Each time I click, the algorithm updates its belief about what content I prefer. Higher scores mean higher confidence."

---

## Algorithm Talking Points

### 1. Thompson Sampling Overview
> "I implemented Thompson Sampling, an industry-standard multi-armed bandit algorithm used by companies like Google and Netflix. It's optimal for balancing exploration and exploitation in online learning scenarios."

### 2. How It Works
> "Each content feature is an 'arm' of the bandit. When I click a source, the algorithm updates a Beta distribution for those features. On the next query, it samples from these distributions to decide which features to boost."

**Technical Details:**
- Beta(α, β) distribution: α = successes + 1, β = failures + 1
- Sampling introduces randomness → exploration
- High-success arms get sampled higher → exploitation
- No manual exploration parameter tuning needed

### 3. LLM Feature Extraction
> "Instead of simple features like domain or recency, I use an LLM to extract semantic features like 'depth: expert vs introductory' and 'style: technical vs casual.' This provides much richer personalization."

**Five Features Extracted:**
1. **Depth:** introductory / moderate / expert
2. **Style:** casual / balanced / technical / academic
3. **Format:** article / tutorial / documentation / blog / news
4. **Approach:** theoretical / balanced / practical
5. **Density:** sparse / moderate / detailed / comprehensive

### 4. Why Thompson Sampling?
> "I chose Thompson Sampling over ε-greedy or UCB because:"
- **Probabilistic matching:** Naturally handles uncertainty
- **No hyperparameters:** No need to tune ε or confidence bounds
- **Proven optimal:** Theoretical guarantees on regret minimization
- **Industry standard:** Battle-tested in production systems

### 5. Personalization Strategy
> "The system applies a multiplicative boost (up to 1.3x) to sources with preferred features. This keeps the base relevance ranking while gently promoting personalized content. Users can see exactly what features drove each boost."

---

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "What if the user's preferences change?"
**A:** Thompson Sampling naturally adapts! If you start clicking different types of sources, the algorithm will shift its distributions. The Beta distribution's variance allows for continuous learning.

### Q: "How do you prevent filter bubbles?"
**A:** 
1. Random sampling ensures exploration (you'll see varied content)
2. Cap boost at 1.3x (can't completely override relevance)
3. Transparent feedback (users see personalization and can adjust behavior)

### Q: "Does this scale to many users?"
**A:** Yes! Each user has their own bandit instance. For production, we'd persist to SQLite/Postgres. The algorithm itself is O(k) where k = number of features, which is constant (5 feature types × ~4 values = ~20 arms max per user).

### Q: "Why not use a neural network?"
**A:** 
- Thompson Sampling works with 1 data point (neural nets need hundreds/thousands)
- Interpretable (you can explain why sources were boosted)
- Low latency (no inference time)
- No training/deployment complexity

### Q: "How did you implement this?"
**A:**
1. **Feature Extraction** (`featureExtractor.ts`): LLM extracts 5 semantic features from source content
2. **Bandit Algorithm** (`bandit.ts`): Thompson Sampling with Beta distributions
3. **Event Tracking** (`store.ts`): Records impressions (SOURCE_EXPANDED) and clicks (SOURCE_CLICKED)
4. **Personalization** (`personalize.ts`): Applies boosts based on bandit scores
5. **UI Feedback** (`PersonalizationBadge.tsx`): Shows learned preferences

## Demo Reset

**Between presentations, reset the demo:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/preferences?userId=demo-user"
```

This clears all bandit state and event history, returning to a clean slate.

## Technical Deep Dive (If Asked)

### Thompson Sampling Math
```
For each feature arm:
  α = successes + 1   (clicks)
  β = failures + 1    (impressions without clicks)
  
  Sample θ ~ Beta(α, β)
  Boost score = θ
```

**Example:**
- `depth:expert` was clicked 2 times, shown 10 times
  - α = 2 + 1 = 3
  - β = 8 + 1 = 9
  - Sample from Beta(3, 9) ≈ 0.25 (mean = 3/12 = 0.25)

- `depth:introductory` was clicked 0 times, shown 10 times
  - α = 0 + 1 = 1
  - β = 10 + 1 = 11
  - Sample from Beta(1, 11) ≈ 0.08 (mean = 1/12 = 0.08)

**Result:** Expert sources get 3x higher boost!

### Simplified Beta Sampling
For MVP, I use a simplified sampling:
```typescript
const mean = α / (α + β);
const noise = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.2; // ±10% exploration
const score = clamp(mean + noise, 0, 1);
```

For production, consider using a proper Beta sampler (e.g., `jstat` library).
